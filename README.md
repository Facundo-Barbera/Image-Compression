# Image Compression utility with Fast Fourier Transform

This is a project that implements image compression using the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) algorithm. 
The idea is to demonstrate how FFT can be used to compress images (e.g., JPEG compression).

## Installation

To run this project, you need to have Python installed along with the required libraries. You can install the necessary libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

Please some images in the `images/raw` directory.

```bash
python main.py
```

## Additional Information

The testing images were provided by `Sergio Aboytes Phtography`.
