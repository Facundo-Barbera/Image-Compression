   abstract = {In the modern era, the issues pertaining with secured, fast and efficient image transmission with limited bandwidth are challenging task. This provides a platform to the researcher to work on image compression-encryption (CE) methodologies. To influence the degree of compression, this paper presents a DCT based compression algorithm using luminous quantization followed by advanced encryption standard (AES) and data encryption standard (DES) encryption methods. In this paper, the effect of encryption over compressed image in terms of PSNR and SSIM is analysed. Efficiency of the AES and DES encryption algorithms are compared based on key space, histogram and differential analysis. The experiment is performed on five different test images. From the results, it is observed that DCT-AES combination of compression-encryption algorithms gives higher resistance to redundant data and provides better security to information during transmission.},

   abstract = {Today, the information exchange has become faster than before. The speed of an information exchange is given by the smallest data sent. The compression method is the solution for making the information smaller than before. The information we discuss in this study is an image data. The image compression is one of the multimedia field which is used by people from past until now, even forever. The purpose of the image compression is to make the size of the image smaller than the original image size. The image compression has several methods, these are Huffman, DCT, DWT, LZW, EZW and much more. The image, we use for the experiment is JPG format. We will use three images for the sample. In this study, we compare the compression size and the compression ratio using Huffman and DCT methods.},

   abstract = {The research article focuses on the Image Compression techniques such as. Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) and Fast Fourier Transform (FFT). These techniques are chosen because of their vast use in image processing field, JPEG (Joint Photographic Experts Group) is one of the examples of compression technique which uses DCT. The Research compares the two compression techniques based on DCT and FFT and compare their results using MATLAB software, Graphical User Interface (GUI). These results are based on two compression techniques with different rates of compression i.e. Compression rates are 90%, 60%, 30% and 5%. The technique allows compressing any picture format to JPG format. The result shows that DCT is better technique than FFT; however the compression results are same as that of 30% compression to 5% compression reflecting not significant change in visual results excepting the file size varying to small fraction. The compression technique works fine with the images having little noise but the compression technique due to its lossy nature don't work very well in medical images such as CT, X-ray etc.},

@article{Hamzah2021,
   abstract = {This paper proposes image compression using discrete cosine transform (DCT) for the format of joint photographic expert groups (JPEG) or JPG, portable network graphic (PNG) and bitmap (BMP). These three extensions are the most popular types used in current image processing storage. The purpose of image compression is to produce lower memory usage or to reduce memory file. This process removes redundant information of each pixel. The challenge for image compression process is to maintain the quality of images after the compression process. Hence, this article utilizes the DCT technique to sustain the image quality and at the same time reduces the image storage size. The effectiveness of the DCT technique has been reasonable over some real images and the implementation of the technique has been compared with different types of image extensions. Matlab software is an important platform for this project in order to write a program and perform the progress of project phase by phase to achieve the expected results. Based on the tested images, the DCT technique in image compression is capable to reduce the image storage memory in average about 50% of each image tested.},
